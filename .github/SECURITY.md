# Security Policy

If you believe you have identified a security issue with a Knight Hacks project, **do not open a public issue**. To responsibly report a security issue, please email [development+security@knighthacks.org](mailto:development+security@knighthacks.org). A security team member will contact you acknowledging the report and how to continue.

Be sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with reporting normal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the maintainers address the issue faster. If you are able, you may also include a fix for the issue generated with `git format-patch`.

Only the current release will receive security patches.
